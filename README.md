# Texture-Updater

A Python script to easily add new textures to the old Minecraft PE (0.14.3) texture atlas

Install pygame before using the script.
Support for TGA texture comming soon (current pygame TGA support is broken).
This script is intended to get the job done in short amount of time, so expect the code not to be good and efficient.
