# Texture-Updater
Trash python script to easily add new textures to the old Minecraft PE (0.14.3) texture atlas

Install pygame before using the script.
Support for TGA texture comming soon (current pygame TGA support is broken).
Place the script, the "vanilla" folder and "data" folder into the same directory, or you can modify file paths in the script to your liking.
This script is intended to get the job done in short amount of time, so expect the code not to be good and efficient.
